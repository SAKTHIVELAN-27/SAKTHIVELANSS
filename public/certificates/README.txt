Place your certificate image here as `meta-cert.png` so the site will display it at `/certificates/meta-cert.png`.

Options to add the actual image:
- Drag the attached image into this folder in your file explorer, rename it to `meta-cert.png`.
- Or upload the image in this chat and tell me to write it to `public/certificates/meta-cert.png`, and I will add it for you.

After the image is present run (or I can run for you):
  npm run build
  npm run preview

If you want me to commit the change to `src/pages/Certificates.tsx` and add the image to the repo, say so and provide the image file here.
